CS351 Assignment 4
Chat Application
    A gui chat application using UDP
	Required to interface with an app on local machine:
		sending messages to port 3515
		receiving messages on port 3514
	Messages are UDP packets containing c_str
	
	Prints messages both sent and received
	
	I added more functionaility:
		Can change ports
		Easy to use side by side with port swap button
		Can change outbount IP
		Can change which IP to listen on
