### A gui chat application using UDP


#### Required to interface with an app on local machine:
 - Sending messages to port 3515
 - Receiving messages on port 3514
 - Messages are UDP packets containing c_str
 - Prints both sent and received messages

#### I added more functionaility:
 - Can change ports
 - Easy to use side by side with port swap button
 - Can change outbount IP
 - Can change which IP to listen on
